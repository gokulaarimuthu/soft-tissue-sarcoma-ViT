# Soft Tissue Sarcoma Evaluation using Vision Transformer (ViT)

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for evaluating soft tissue sarcoma using a Vision Transformer (ViT) algorithm. The ViT model is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that has shown promising results in various computer vision tasks, including medical image analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow (optional, for data preprocessing)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tqdm (optional, for progress bars)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gokulaarimuthu/soft-tissue-sarcoma-evaluation.git
    cd soft-tissue-sarcoma-evaluation
    ```



## Dataset
The dataset used for this evaluation consists of soft tissue sarcoma images collected from various medical sources. Due to privacy and copyright concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain it from [provide the source or instructions for obtaining the dataset].

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** If necessary, preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training/testing. This may include tasks such as resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation. Use TensorFlow or any other preferred tool for this purpose.

2. **Training:** Train the Vision Transformer model using the preprocessed dataset. You can adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set. Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance in detecting soft tissue sarcoma.

4. **Visualization:** Visualize the model predictions and performance metrics using Matplotlib or any other visualization library.
